# demo_data

This project can be used to create data similar to that found in PIS, SMR00, and SMR01 from ISD

The code in demo.Rmd creates four dataframes:  

city_pop has the demographic details for each person in a population  
rx has the prescribing (PIS) for one year for the population  
op has the outpatient care (SMR00) for one year for the population  
ip has the inpatient care (SMR01) for one year for the population
